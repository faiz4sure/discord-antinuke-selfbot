## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js if you don't have it already
# Clone or download this repository
git clone https://github.com/faiz4sure/discord-antinuke-selfbot.git
cd discord-antinuke-selfbot

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration
1. Edit the `config/config.yaml` file:
   - Add your Discord token (required)
   - Add your Owner IDs (your Discord user ID)
   - Set Protected server IDs (the servers you want to protect)
   - Add whitelist users (trusted admins who won't trigger protection)
   - Adjust action thresholds and timeframes if needed
   - Configure other security settings as needed

The config file structure looks like this:
```yaml
selfbot:
  token: "YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE" # Your account token
  server1_id: "111222333444555666" # First server to protect
  server2_id: "222333444555666777" # Second server to protect
  owner1_id: "123456789012345678" # Your Discord user ID
  owner2_id: "234567890123456789" # Another owner ID (optional)
  
antinuke_settings:
  punishment: "ban" # Options: "ban", "kick", "none"
  # Various limits for different actions
  
whitelisted:
  users: ["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789"] # Trusted admin IDs
```

Alternatively, you can use environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file with `DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here`

### 3. Starting the Selfbot
```bash
# Start the selfbot
node index.js
```

  server2_id: "222333444555666777" # Second server to protect (optional)
  owner1_id: "123456789012345678" # Your Discord user ID (for notifications)
  owner2_id: "234567890123456789" # Another owner ID (optional)
  
antinuke_settings:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions

1. **Account Security**: Keep your Discord token secure. Never share it with others.
2. **TOS Violation**: Remember that selfbots violate Discord's Terms of Service.
3. **Permissions**: The selfbot needs Administrator permission in protected servers.
4. **False Positives**: Configure thresholds carefully to avoid accidental triggers.
5. **Role Hierarchy**: Ensure the selfbot's role is high enough in the hierarchy.
6. **Backup**: Keep backups of your server settings in case of issues.
7. **Hosting**: Don't run on your main PC - use a dedicated hosting service.

## üåê Hosting Recommendations

While you can run this on your own device, we strongly recommend using a dedicated hosting service for:
- 24/7 uptime
- Better reliability
- Lower risk to your personal devices and network

**Recommended hosting options:**
- VPS providers (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc.)
- NodeJS hosting services
- Replit (with hacks to prevent sleep)
